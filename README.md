A story of a unstable mind.

A guy who was born with slower cognitive development and a horrible memory problem.

He loved god and god gave him fear 

In his 20 his brain may have developed significantly, laced with many thoughts and wondered why was he like that.. weak and stupid.. wanted to change everything around him.
he started taking care of him.
he was still stuck with memory problems and numbers... yeah whenever he sees numbers his brain goes in panic mode , this made him terrible at mathematics.

not a big deal , his dad wanted him to be doctor, well he didn't have faith in that, and he always liked nature and ... physics irrespective of numbers 

he decided to take computer science after failing JEE, his mind was far stable and better than before. he had a good faith he will make his life great, and also came to conclusion, 

GOD DOESN'T EXIST 
IT'S MADE FOR WEAK 
RELIGION AND PATRIOTISM IS MADE SO HIGHER POWER CAN CONTROL THE WEAK
AND BOTH IF THEM ARE SIGN IF LOW INTELLIGENCE 

starting of the semester got him , somehow he managed to climb up , minecraft and other games got his attention, got him intrested in tech and programs 

He fell in love with technology 
He exceeded the potential limit again, felt like a new birth

casually acing the studies
still his number problem wasn't solved

now he wants more 
as he became sharp and intelligent, his mind started getting unstable 
Mood swings are super common 

tired to see how the world operates and wanted to change it but unfortunately he lacked power, without power he can't do shit 

he was tired of seeing idiotic stuff everywhere, toxicity and racism was at its peak 

deleted social medias so it doesn't hinder his mental state 
yet wanted to change for good 

Also he didn't want to stay on his country, thinking the culture is probably holding some knowledge form him.

rejected a few job options from his country and decided to move to a stable and relatively cheap country.

That him is me 

I feel empty , I feel like I need something I lack knowledge I don't know what.

doubting myself if I will ever achieve that high 
Am I enough or just another retarded

I am tired of my life.

I'll be updating stuff here about how I feel and my progress on whatever I'm trying to achieve.
